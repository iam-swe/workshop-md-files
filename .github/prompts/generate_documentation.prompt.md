# Instructions for Copilot

You are tasked with creating **comprehensive documentation** for this repository.  


## Goals
1. **Repository Overview**
   - Explain the purpose of the repository.
   - Describe the main architecture and design patterns used.
   - Highlight dependencies, frameworks, and any notable configurations.

2. **Code Structure**
   - Provide a clear breakdown of directories and their roles (e.g., `agents/`, `tools/`, `tests/`).
   - Describe how the components interact (e.g., how agents call tools, how tests are organized).
   - Document important modules and their responsibilities.

3. **Detailed Explanations**
   - For each important file/class/function, explain what it does, its inputs, outputs, and side effects.
   - Document workflows (e.g., request handling, task execution, test flow).
   - Show example usage or flow diagrams where relevant.

4. **Agents & Tools**
   - Explain what agents exist, their roles, and how they are invoked.
   - Document available tools, their parameters, and expected outputs.

5. **Tests**
   - Describe the testing approach (unit, integration, end-to-end).
   - Highlight key test files and what they validate.
   - Mention how to run the tests.

6. **Best Practices / Notes**
   - Document coding conventions or patterns observed in the repo.
   - Provide notes on extensibility, customization, and limitations.

## Output Format
- The output should be **structured documentation** with:
  - `#` headings for major sections
  - `##` subheadings for subsections
  - Bullet points and tables where necessary
- The writing should be **professional, clear, and detailed** (not superficial).
- Include examples, explanations, and insights wherever possible.
